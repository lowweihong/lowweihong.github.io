# <image src="/images/man-technologist.png" height="30" width="30"> About me

I am a current Master's student at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, and I am eager to participate in research opportunities to enhance my analytical skills and deepen my expertise in Natural Language Processing, particularly its applications in social media.

---

*As a hands-on data scientist and problem-solving enthusiast, I am always eager to take on new technical challenges that allow me to learn and feed my curiosity. I have experience in NLP and machine learning, including developing and fine-tuning models, optimizing performance, and managing the lifecycle of ML applications. I've worked on projects involving multi-language translation using models like NLLB. I enjoy environments that require quick prototyping and innovative thinking, where I can transform complex data into practical insights, particularly in predictive modeling and data-driven strategies.*

## Previous work experiences

- **Senior Data Scientist** - OKX (Singapore):  
  At OKX, I focused on rapid prototyping and stakeholder management, building a centralized web crawling platform with Docker to streamline data pipelines. I developed a machine translation system supporting 13 language pairs on Alicloud's PAI platform, reducing vendor costs by 35%. Additionally, I created data-driven dashboards on Alicloud to provide clear insights through effective visualizations.

- **NLP Data Scientist** - Shopee (Singapore):  
  At Shopee, I worked on improving platform integrity by detecting seller behaviors such as the repetitive use of different brand names to artificially boost product visibility. Additionally, I fine-tuned multimodal models (*ALBEF* and *CLIP*), text models (*CNN*, *BERT*, *fasttext*) to classify vast amounts of product listings into appropriate categories, enhancing user experience and streamlining platform operations.

## Education

- **Master of Science** - Georgia Tech (Atlanta)
  Current student in masters of sciences in computer sciences, specialising in machine learning. Expected graduation end of year 2025.

- **Undergraduate Exchange Program** - Charles University (Prague)

- **Bachelor of Science** - Nanyang Technological University (Singapore):  
  I graduated from Nanyang Technological University Singapore in May 2018, majoring in *Mathematics* and *Economics*.
