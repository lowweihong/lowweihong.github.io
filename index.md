---

As a Master's candidate at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning (expected graduation December 2025), I am passionate about leveraging advanced analytical techniques, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), to solve complex data challenges. I have a keen interest in areas such as social media analytics, predictive modeling, and the practical application of machine learning models to drive impactful business outcomes.

*I am a hands-on data scientist and problem-solving enthusiast, always eager to take on new technical challenges that allow me to learn and feed my curiosity. My experience encompasses the full lifecycle of ML applications, including developing and fine-tuning models (like NLLB for multi-language translation), optimizing performance, and managing deployments. I thrive in environments that require quick prototyping and innovative thinking, where I can transform complex data into actionable insights, particularly in predictive modeling and data-driven strategies.*

## Previous work experiences

- **Senior Data Scientist** - OKX (Singapore):  
  * Focused on rapid prototyping and stakeholder management.
  * Built a centralized web crawling platform using Docker to streamline data pipelines and enhance data acquisition efficiency.
  * Developed and deployed a machine translation system on Alicloud's PAI platform, supporting 13 language pairs, which **reduced vendor costs by 35%**.
  * Created data-driven dashboards on Alicloud, providing clear insights into [e.g., key operational metrics or user behavior trends], enabling [e.g., data-informed decision-making for the product team or optimization of marketing spend].


- **NLP Data Scientist** - Shopee (Singapore):  
  * Worked on improving platform integrity by developing systems to detect seller behaviors such as the repetitive use of different brand names to artificially boost product visibility.
  * Fine-tuned multimodal models (ALBEF and CLIP) and text models (CNN, BERT, fastText) to classify vast amounts of product listings into appropriate categories. This initiative [e.g., improved product categorization accuracy by X%, leading to a Y% increase in user click-through rates on recommended products] and streamlined platform operations by [e.g., reducing manual categorization efforts by Z%].
