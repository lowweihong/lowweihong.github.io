# About me

---

*As a hands-on data scientist and problem-solving enthusiast, I am always eager to take on new technical challenges that allow me to learn and feed my curiosity. I have experience in NLP and machine learning, including developing and fine-tuning models, optimizing performance, and managing the lifecycle of ML applications. I've worked on projects involving multi-language translation using models like NLLB. I enjoy environments that require quick prototyping and innovative thinking, where I can transform complex data into practical insights, particularly in predictive modeling and data-driven strategies.*
