## NLP

- [**HatefulMeme challenge**](https://github.com/lowweihong/meme-challenge): In this project, I worked on detecting harmful content in multimodal datasets, inspired by challenges like Meta's Hateful Memes. The key challenge was aligning text and image data to capture subtle, context-sensitive relationships. I tackled this by integrating advanced NLP and computer vision techniques for cohesive analysis.

## Dashboard - community projects

- [**Covid19 Face Shield Group Dashboard**](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1aaae16a-b02e-4742-b2c7-b7d13e5f1dff/page/4qCLB): Developed a dashboard for a community-driven initiative to supply and track face shield donations for Covid-19 frontliners, enabling smooth coordination and impactful contributions.
